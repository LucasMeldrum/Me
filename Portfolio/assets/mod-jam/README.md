# Frogfrogfrog

A game about catching flies... but there's a twist. Catch too many and they might fight back!
Use A and D to move and spacebar to attack. Goodluck! 

Used similar code for movement of flies from the original Frogfrogfrog and array ideas we learnt in class (projectiles and flies)

### Changes made to the orginial:
- Title screen (with working buttons)
- End screen (with working buttons)
- Stages in the game
- Points counted by filling up fly jar
- Sounds (tongue, peaceful and intense all found here: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/)
- Dialogue
- Changed the game into a combat/boss fight
- Controls (A and D + spacebar)
- Flies movement during boss fight (track the player)
- Boss fly movement and attack abilities
- Frog health
- Boss health
- Color changes depending on which phase/stage of game you are in
- Probably more related to the boss/combat and phases but main stuff all pointed out.
