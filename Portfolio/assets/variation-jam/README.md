## Description
This project combines three versions of the Atari 1982 game Yars Revenge:

#### Variation 1 - Yars Revenge in p5
A straightforward remake of the original Yars Revenge concept. The player controls the Yar using WASD and shoots with Mouse1. Use the neutral zone to dodge attacks and protect yourself, you only have one life!

---

#### Variation 2 - PvP  Mode
Same Yars Revenge but now you can play against your friend! One player is Yar (WASD and Mouse1 again) and the other controls the boss (use up/down arrow keys to move, left to shoot and right for shockwave). Challenge your friend to a duel!

---

#### Variation 3 - Dark/Sound Mode
A tense variation where most of the screen is dark. Dynamic light circles follow the player, boss, bullets, and shockwaves, limiting visibility and turning every movement into a risk. Awareness and tracking become the real challenge!
